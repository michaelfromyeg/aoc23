# Advent of Code

2023 edition.

Run a day with `python -m dayX.dayX`.

It's recommended to use Python 3.12.

## TO-DOs

Days I have to come back to...

- [ ] Day 5, part 2
  - (The brute force is far too slow; I need to write code to 'shift' whole ranges)
- [ ] Day 9, part 2
  - I'm close, but I just need to work out the indexing and correct 'transpose' to compute the grid in the other direction
